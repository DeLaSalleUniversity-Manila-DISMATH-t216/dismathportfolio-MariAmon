<H1>Week 1</H1>
<UL>
<LI>I was introduced to the subject-Dismath-which is about logic using mathematical proof.</LI>
<LI>Proposition and the process of logical deduction are presented to me.</LI>
<LI>Logical connectives-in terms of symbols-are introduced </LI>
<LI>I learned how to use truth tables in determining truth value of propositions.</LI>
<LI>I learned of the contrapositive, inverse and converse of a conditional statement p → q,which is ¬q → ¬p, ¬p → ¬q and q → p,respectively.</LI>
</UL>

<H1>Week 2</H1>
<UL>
<LI>I learned the logical equivalences and performed logical induction in proving these laws.</LI>
<LI>Propositional logic was introduced-presenting its internal structure:subject and predicate logic.</LI>
<LI>Truth value is classified into two: existential and universal, and are presented using quantifiers.</LI>
<LI>I learned the difference between validity-correct reasoning in terms of pattern(opposite of fallacy) and truth value of the proposition.</LI>
<LI>I learned the use of rules of inference in analyzing and determining truth value of english statements.</LI>
