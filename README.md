<H1>Week 1</H1>
<UL>
<LI>I was introduced to the subject-Dismath-which is about logic using mathematical proof.</LI>
<LI>Proposition and the process of logical deduction are presented to me.</LI>
<LI>Logical connectives-in terms of symbols-are introduced </LI>
<LI>I learned how to use truth tables in determining truth value of propositions.</LI>
<LI>I learned of the contrapositive, inverse and converse of a conditional statement p → q,which is ¬q → ¬p, ¬p → ¬q and q → p,respectively.</LI>
</UL>
<br>
<H1>Week 2</H1>
<UL>
<LI>I learned the logical equivalences and performed logical induction in proving these laws.</LI>
<LI>Propositional logic was introduced-presenting its internal structure:subject and predicate logic.</LI>
<LI>Truth value is classified into two: existential and universal, and are presented using quantifiers.</LI>
<LI>I learned the difference between validity-correct reasoning in terms of pattern(opposite of fallacy) and truth value of the proposition.</LI>
<LI>I learned the use of rules of inference in analyzing and determining truth value of english statements.</LI>
</UL>
#Week 3
<UL>
<LI>I learned how to prove statements using the rules of inference.</LI>
<LI>The proof that Superman doesn't exist was presented in class.</LI>
<LI>I learned the different methods of proof:direct proof, proof by contraposition, as well as, vacuous and trivial proof.</LI>
<LI>Examples and activities are presented to show application of each method of proof.</LI>
</UL>
#Week 4
<UL>
<LI>The methods of vacuous and of trivial proof are further explained to clarify their difference.</LI>
<LI>The method of proof by contradiction, which I think is the trickiest method of all, was then presented.</LI>
<LI>I almost forgot about EngAlg2 until Mathematical Induction was reinforced to the class. </LI>
<LI>In performing mathematical method, one must always follow the properprocedure which is to perform basis stap first before proceeding to the main process.</LI>
<LI>Recursive statements are introduced.</LI>
</UL>
#Week 5
<UL>
<LI>Recursive Algorithm, being discussed, is a step by step process of reducing a problem to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.</LI>
<LI>Programs of factorial and of power rule were presented as examples of recursive algorithm.</LI>
<LI>Program Verification was discussed and how to present proof of correctness of programs with the use of rules of inference.</LI>
<LI>A program is only considered correct if it produces correct output for every possible input.</LI>
<LI>To prove correctness of a program, one must (1)Show Partial Correctness of program and (2) Show that program always terminates.</LI>
<LI>Partial correctness can be done through the use of Hoare Triple, p{s}q, wherein we assume that p is true, then we substitute p to s to show/prove truth value of q.</LI>
<LI>Program correctness can also be proven through the rules of inference: Composition rule, conditional statement and if-else statement.</LI>
<LI>Zeno's Paradox and Power Series were introduced.</LI>
<LI>The formulation of the summation of power series or the Geometric Progression was taught.>
  <UL><LI>summation of ax^n=a1/(1-r)</LI></UL>  </LI
<LI>Set, as then discussed, is an unordered collection of distinct objects.</LI>
<LI>Sets can be presented using Set builder Notation.
  <UL><LI>{x|some property x satisies}</LI></UL>  </LI>
<LI>There are different relationship between sets.
<UL><LI>Union(or)</LI><LI>Intersection(and)</LI><LI>Difference</LI><LI>Symmetric Difference</LI></UL>
</UL>
<LI>I learned that if all elements of Set A are found in B, then set A is a subset of B.</LI>
</UL>
#Week 6
<UL>
<LI>Cardinality was discussed which is is a measure of the number of elements of the set denoted by {A}.</LI>
<LI>Functions was introduced. This is relationship between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs given that each input is has exactly one output.</LI>
<LI>I learned the difference between the range-the set of outputs, and the codomain-the set of all possible outputs, of a function.</LI>
<LI>Different types of Functions:
<UL>
<LI>One-To-One Function
<BR>If and only if f(a)=f(b) implies that a=b for all a and b in the domain of f.</LI>
<LI>Onto Function<
<BR>If the range and domain are equal and that every member of the codomain is the image of some element of the domain.</LI>
<LI>Bijection
If it is both one-to-one and onto.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
#Week 7
No classes
#Week 8
<UL>
<LI>We discussed Algorithms which is a set of rules to be followed in problem-solving by a computer.</LI>
<LI>Pseudocodes are a high-level desciprtion of an algorithm that uses structural convention of a programming language, but is intended for human reading.</LI>
<LI>Properties of a psuedocode: Input and Output (or result)</LI>
<LI>There are two procedure in searching the location of an element discussed:
<BR>input: { A1, A2, ..., An }
<BR>output: index { found: {1, ..., n} ; else: -1 }
<UL><LI>Linear Search-one by one search</LI>
<LI>Binary Search-(precondition: elements are in increasing order); continuously divides the set into two and compare them until the first and last element is the same; then compares equaliy between the last element and the actual number being located.</LI></UL>
</LI>
</UL>
#Week 9
<UL>
<LI>Sorting-arranging elements of a list in increasing order</LI>
<LI>There are two types of sorting algorithms:
<UL><LI>Bubble Sort-the highest value element bubbles up the list; this algorithm uses two for-loops that compares an element with the rest of the elements/numbers.</LI>
<LI>Insertion Sort-first element is always considered sorted; this algorithn places an element in order by comparing and inserting it into the already sorted elements of the set.</LI></UL>
</LI>
<LI>Greedy Algorithm in obtaining the least number of coins as change was introduced.</LI> 
<LI>Greedy Algorithm works by providing a set of denomination arranged in increasing order. The program continuously divides the entered value(amount of money) by the first element in the list until it can no longer do so, and that will be the time that the program shall proceed to the next element in the denomination list.</LI>
