<H1>Week 1</H1>
<UL>
<LI>I was introduced to the subject-Dismath-which is about logic using mathematical proof.</LI>
<LI>Proposition and the process of logical deduction are presented to me.</LI>
<LI>Logical connectives-in terms of symbols-are introduced </LI>
<LI>I learned how to use truth tables in determining truth value of propositions.</LI>
<LI>I learned of the contrapositive, inverse and converse of a conditional statement p → q,which is ¬q → ¬p, ¬p → ¬q and q → p,respectively.</LI>
</UL>
<br>
<H1>Week 2</H1>
<UL>
<LI>I learned the logical equivalences and performed logical induction in proving these laws.</LI>
<LI>Propositional logic was introduced-presenting its internal structure:subject and predicate logic.</LI>
<LI>Truth value is classified into two: existential and universal, and are presented using quantifiers.</LI>
<LI>I learned the difference between validity-correct reasoning in terms of pattern(opposite of fallacy) and truth value of the proposition.</LI>
<LI>I learned the use of rules of inference in analyzing and determining truth value of english statements.</LI>
</UL>
#Week 3
<UL>
<LI>I learned how to prove statements using the rules of inference.</LI>
<LI>The proof that Superman doesn't exist was presented in class.</LI>
<LI>I learned the different methods of proof:direct proof, proof by contraposition, as well as, vacuous and trivial proof.</LI>
<LI>Examples and activities are presented to show application of each method of proof.</LI>
</UL>
#Week 4
<UL>
<LI>The methods of vacuous and of trivial proof are further explained to clarify their difference.</LI>
<LI>The method of proof by contradiction, which I think is the trickiest method of all, was then presented.</LI>
<LI>I almost forgot about EngAlg2 until Mathematical Induction was reinforced to the class. </LI>
<LI>In performing mathematical method, one must always follow the properprocedure which is to perform basis stap first before proceeding to the main process.</LI>
<LI>Recursive statements are introduced.</LI>
</UL>
